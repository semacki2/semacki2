Hello! My name Seth Mackie and I am a data analyst & engineer.

I have spent the past 4+ years working as a Software and Application Developer for the State of Nebraska; specifically, I built software solutions that enabled state agencies to transition to being entirely paperless. My solutions are currently in production allowing state agencies such as the Nebraska Department of Transportation and the Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance to electronically store and retrieve documents, access dashboards, receive automated reports, manage workflows, import data, and collaborate on projects. 

As a perpetual learner, my biggest hobby is taking online courses and leveling up. About a year ago, I happened across a fun little course on YouTube called “The Nature of Code” on the Coding Train channel. Professor Dan Shiffman teaches how to use code to create art. His joy and passion are absolutely contagious, and you can’t help but smile along as he teaches you about the fundamentals of code, physics equations, evolutionary biology, and more. The course concluded with an introduction to 2 big ideas that I had heard of but never really learned about: machine learning and deep learning.

I was hooked.

I’ve always been an analytical person and for 4 years I’ve been knee-deep in big data projects building enterprise-level 
software for state agencies. I wrote SQL queries, created automated reports and dashboards, forms to collect data, and backend processes to collect and store the data. My professional life has been defined by working with data: collecting it, manipulating it, storing it, and retrieving it. Now, I want to understand it.

Since first being introduced to machine learning, I’ve dove head-first into data analysis. I’ve completed the 37 week Data Analytics certification from Google where I received hands-on experience with tools I was already comfortable with such as spreadsheets, pivot tables, and SQL, while also being introduced to data visualization tools like Tableau and the R programming language. I’ve also completed online courses on Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Python where I learned to create models to analyze complex data sets to categorize observations and make predictions. I’ve also started exploring the data science community on Kaggle.com and am excited to start competing in their competitions.

We humans are gathering so much data, but that’s not good enough; we need to be able to find meaning in our data that we can act upon. Using evidence and facts to develop a deeper understanding of complex problems is extremely fulfilling for me, which is why I’m drawn to work with data. I believe most good things can be made better through data-driven decision making and I’m eager to work on a team where I can help make that happen. I have a lot of technical skills that can be an asset to your company and I won’t ever stop acquiring more.
