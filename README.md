- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @semacki2. My real name is Seth Mackie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning libraries with python.
- ðŸ“« Email me at sethjmackie@gmail.com if you'd like to get in touch.

Iâ€™ve spent the last 4 years working as a Software and Application Developer for the State of Nebraska. For the past 9 months, Iâ€™ve used my free time to learn about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning and Iâ€™m excited to pivot my career in this direction. While I continue to learn more about the advanced computer science and mathematics that power these emerging technologies, I am excited to step into this field as a data analyst.

I recently completed the Google Data Analytics career course through Coursera.com, which served to refresh and refine skills I already had, as well as introduce me to new ideas and technologies that will make me a useful asset to your company.

My ideal working environment would be one that would allow me to use the talents and experience I already have as a developer, as well as the new skills Iâ€™ll continue to pursue and develop as I grow.

Using evidence and facts to develop a deeper understanding of complex problems is extremely fulfilling for me, which is why Iâ€™m drawn to work with data. I believe most good things can be made better through data-driven decision making and Iâ€™m eager to work on a team where I can help make that happen.
